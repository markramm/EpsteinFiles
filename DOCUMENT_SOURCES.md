```

Or use Python:
```bash
pip install PyPDF2 pdfplumber
python download_and_convert.py  # See download_and_convert.py script
```

## Bloomberg Emails - Special Considerations

The Bloomberg Yahoo emails present unique challenges:

**Legal Considerations:**
- Bloomberg obtained these through investigative journalism
- Unclear if raw emails are public records
- May contain sensitive/private information

**Access Options:**
1. **Check if Bloomberg made data available**: Contact Bloomberg News data team
2. **FOIA Request**: Request emails from FBI/DOJ if they have copies
3. **Court Records**: Some emails may be in court filings
4. **Wait for House Release**: House Oversight may receive and release these

**Recommendation**: Focus first on official House Oversight and court documents, which are definitively public records.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Manual reconnaissance**: Visit House Oversight pages, identify exact download links
2. **Download initial batch**: Start with November 2025 estate docs (most recent)
3. **Convert and test**: Ensure PDF-to-text conversion quality is good
4. **Rebuild index**: Run search indexer on new documents
5. **Verify search**: Test searches on new content
6. **Document findings**: Update README with new statistics
